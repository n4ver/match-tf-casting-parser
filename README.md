# match-tf-casting-parser
Python program to parse match.tf tournament details into usable Casting Essentials aliases to use for casting.
Simply run the program by inputting the match.tf tournament page, and the program will generate a cast_aliases.cfg file that can be run in the TF2 client.
The program also outputs a real_aliases.json file compatible with my stream log showcase (currently private).
