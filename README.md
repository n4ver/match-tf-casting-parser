# Match.tf username webscraper
Python program to scrape match.tf tournament details into usable Casting Essentials aliases to use for casting.

## Usage
run `python main.py` and input the match.tf tournament URL, and the program will generate a cast_aliases.cfg file that can be executed in the TF2 client with the Casting Essentials plugin\
The program also creates a real_aliases.json file compatible with my other private repositories
